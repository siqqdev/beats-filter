# beats-filter-frontend

This website is made to simplify the task of beatmakers in organizing their beats.

## Problem Statement

Every beatmaker has likely faced the challenge of sorting their beats, especially when requested to submit beats in a specific style via email. It becomes challenging to recall the style of each beat when you create multiple beats daily.

## Solution

BeatSorter resolves this issue by allowing you to upload all your beats with just a few clicks and categorize them by genre. The next time you're asked to submit beats, for instance, in the Dark Trap style, you can simply visit the website, choose the style, and view all the beats you've uploaded in that particular genre. You can listen to them, and download beats that you liked.

## Unique Features

- Titles of downloaded beats (MP3 files) are generated based on the information you provide when uploading the beat through the form.

## Tech Stack

The site is developed using React + TypeScript.
